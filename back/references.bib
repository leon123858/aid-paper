  ABSTRACT = {Internet of Things (IoT) is used to describe devices with sensors that connect and exchange data with other devices or systems on the Internet or other communication networks. Actually, the data not only represent the concrete things connected but also describe the abstract matters related. Therefore, it is expected to support trust on IoT since blockchain was invented so that trusted IoT could be possible or, recently, even metaverse could be imaginable. However, IoT systems are usually composed of a lot of device nodes with limited computing power. The built-in unsolved performance and energy-consumption problems in blockchain become more critical in IoT. The other problems such as finality, privacy, or scalability introduce even more complexity so that trusted IoT is still far from realization, let alone the metaverse. With general Proof of Work (GPoW), the energy consumption of Bitcoin can be reduced to less than 1 billionth and proof of PowerTimestamp (PoPT) can be constructed so that a global even ordering can be reached to conduct synchronization on distributed systems in real-time. Therefore, trusted IoT is possible. We reintroduce GPoW with more mathematic proofs so that PoPT can be optimal and describe how PoPT can be realized with simulation results, mining examples and synchronization scenario toward trusted IoT.},

abstract = {The architecture of the Internet is based on a number of principles, including the self-describing datagram packet, the end to end arguments, diversity in technology and global addressing. As the Internet has moved from a research curiosity to a recognized component of mainstream society, new requirements have emerged that suggest new design principles, and perhaps suggest that we revisit some old ones. This paper explores one important reality that surrounds the Internet today: different stakeholders that are part of the Internet milieu have interests that may be adverse to each other, and these parties each vie to favor their particular interests. We call this process "the tussle". Our position is that accommodating this tussle is crucial to the evolution of the network's technical architecture. We discuss some examples of tussle, and offer some technical design principles that take it into account.},

We discuss a set of principles that have guided the design of the Internet, called the end-to-end arguments, and we conclude that there is a risk that the range of new requirements now emerging could have the consequence of compromising the Internet's original design principles. Were this to happen, the Internet might lose some of its key features, in particular its ability to support new and unanticipated applications. We link this possible outcome to a number of trends: the rise of new stakeholders in the Internet, in particular Internet service providers; new government interests; the changing motivations of a growing user base; and the tension between the demand for trustworthy overall operation and the inability to trust the behavior of individual users.},

abstract = {Digital identities represent who we are when engaging in online activities and transactions. The rapid growth in the number of online services leads to in an increasing number of different identities that each user needs to manage. As a result, many people feel overloaded with identities and suffer from password fatigue. This is a serious problem and makes people unable properly control and protect their digital identities against identity theft. This paper discusses the usability and privacy in online identity management solutions, and proposed a general approach for making users better able to control and manage their digital identities, as well as for creating more secure identity management solutions. More specifically, we propose a user-centric approach based on hardware and software technology on the user-side with the aim of assisting users when accessing online services.},

abstract = {Millions of web users today employ their Facebook accounts to sign into more than one million relying party (RP) websites. This web-based single sign-on (SSO) scheme is enabled by OAuth 2.0, a web resource authorization protocol that has been adopted by major service providers. The OAuth 2.0 protocol has proven secure by several formal methods, but whether it is indeed secure in practice remains an open question. We examine the implementations of three major OAuth identity providers (IdP) (Facebook, Microsoft, and Google) and 96 popular RP websites that support the use of Facebook accounts for login. Our results uncover several critical vulnerabilities that allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the victim user's profile and social graph, and impersonate the victim on the RP website. Closer examination reveals that these vulnerabilities are caused by a set of design decisions that trade security for implementation simplicity. To improve the security of OAuth 2.0 SSO systems in real-world settings, we suggest simple and practical improvements to the design and implementation of IdPs and RPs that can be adopted gradually by individual sites.},

abstract = {Device fingerprinting is commonly used for tracking users. We explore device fingerprinting but in the specific context of use for augmenting authentication, providing a state-of-the-art view and analysis. We summarize and classify 29 available methods and their properties; define attack models relevant to augmenting passwords for user authentication; and qualitatively compare them based on stability, repeatability, resource use, client passiveness, difficulty of spoofing, and distinguishability offered.},

pages="179--192",
abstract="Trust propagation is the principle by which new trust relationships can be derived from pre-existing trust relationship. Trust transitivity is the most explicit form of trust propagation, meaning for example that if Alice trusts Bob, and Bob trusts Claire, then by transitivity, Alice will also trust Claire. This assumes that Bob recommends Claire to Alice. Trust fusion is also an important element in trust propagation, meaning that Alice can combine Bob's recommendation with her own personal experience in dealing with Claire, or with other recommendations about Claire, in order to derive a more reliable measure of trust in Claire. These simple principles, which are essential for human interaction in business and everyday life, manifests itself in many different forms. This paper investigates possible formal models that can be implemented using belief reasoning based on subjective logic. With good formal models, the principles of trust propagation can be ported to online communities of people, organisations and software agents, with the purpose of enhancing the quality of those communities.",

This survey takes a journey through the origin of identity, defining digital identity and progressive iterations of digital identity models leading up to self-sovereign identity. It then states the relevant research initiatives, platforms, projects, and regulatory frameworks, as well as the building blocks including decentralized identifiers, verifiable credentials, distributed ledger, and various privacy engineering protocols. Finally, the survey provides an overview of the key challenges and research opportunities around self-sovereign identity.},
